## Deep Dive Insights

### Key Phrases for B2-B3 Level

| Index | Phrase | Insight | Band |
|-------|--------|---------|------|
| 15 | "legally obligated" | Formal term used in landlord-tenant disputes. Signals knowledge of rights and responsibilities. Shows confident, assertive communication. | 8 |
| 16 | "in a habitable condition" | Legal/formal property terminology. More sophisticated than "good condition". Shows tenant awareness of legal standards. | 8 |
| 17 | "health and safety issue" | Bureaucratic phrasing that carries weight in property disputes. Signals seriousness and potential legal implications. | 8 |
| 21 | "propose a timeline" | Professional negotiation language. Shows initiative and collaboration rather than complaint. | 7-8 |
| 32 | "commitment to resolve" | Diplomatic phrasing that acknowledges goodwill. Maintains positive relationship while remaining firm. | 7 |

| 38 | "complete assessment/inventory" | Shows preference for comprehensive solutions rather than piecemeal fixes. Signals strategic thinking. | 7-8 |

### Linguistic Challenges at B2

1. **Diplomacy under pressure** - Using formal language while expressing frustration
2. **Negotiation techniques** - Making requests sound collaborative, not demanding
3. **Legal/formal vocabulary** - Property-specific terms (habitable, lease obligations, repairs)
4. **Time management language** - Discussing timelines, urgency, priorities
5. **Passive vs. Active responsibility** - "Should be done" vs. "I/you should do it"
6. **Conditional structures** - "Could you...?" "Would...be possible?" for politeness

## Teaching Notes

### Difficulty Level: B2
- Requires professional register and formal vocabulary
- Involves negotiation and maintaining composure
- Tests ability to express concerns diplomatically
- Includes legal/formal concepts (habitable condition, obligations)

### Key Skills Tested
1. **Register switching** - Professional but not aggressive
2. **Negotiation language** - Making proposals, requesting timelines
3. **Problem reporting** - Describing issues clearly and urgently
4. **Assertiveness** - Knowing rights and communicating them confidently

### Common Mistakes to Address
- Using "demand" instead of "request" or "propose"
- Sounding too casual ("The heating is broken, can you fix it?")
- Not understanding tenant rights (habitable condition requirement)
- Failing to prioritize (mixing urgent with non-urgent issues)
- Being too aggressive, damaging landlord relationship

### Extensions
- Role reversal: Landlord explaining why repairs are delayed
- Written email version: Formal complaint letter to landlord
- Advanced: Adding dispute resolution or threat of legal action

### Real-World Context
This scenario reflects:
- UK/US tenant rights (habitable standard)
- Common residential issues (water leaks, heating, windows)
- Realistic landlord response times
- Negotiation dynamics in rental disputes
- Professional tone balancing firmness with politeness
