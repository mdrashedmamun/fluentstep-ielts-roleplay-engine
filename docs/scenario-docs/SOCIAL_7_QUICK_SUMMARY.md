## 🎯 What Was Built

### Phase 1: Extended Dialogue (12 turns)
- Greeting + catch-up
- Kitchen rules discussion
- Trash disposal protocol (with response!)
- Noise hours negotiation
- Friendly closing with WhatsApp coordination

### Phase 2: Optimized Blanks (14 total, 86% high-value)
- Kept all 7 original (all high-value)
- Added 7 new: "take", "Should", "separate", "ground rules", "laid-back", "noisy", "enough"

### Phase 3: ChunkFeedbackV2 (14 entries)
- Pattern-focused explanations (not definitions)
- Realistic learner mistakes with native fixes
- Cultural insights on UK flatmate etiquette

### Phase 4: BlankInOrder Mapping
- Perfect 1:1 mapping of all 14 blanks to chunks
- No gaps, no duplicates, sequential indexing

### Phase 5: PatternSummary
- 4 categories: Openers, Softening, Idioms, Exit
- 3 key patterns with detailed explanations
- Overall insight on British boundary negotiation style

### Phase 6: Active Recall Questions (8)
- Mix of fill-gap and selection questions
- Cover 57% of blanks (7/14) = high-value chunks only
- Designed for spaced repetition testing

### Phase 7: Clean Architecture
- Removed legacy deepDive array
- Pure V2 schema (no duplication)

## 🎓 Learning Impact

**User Experience Before**:
- Load → Fill blanks → Done (1-2 min)
- No feedback, no pattern summary, no repetition

**User Experience After**:
