## COMPLETE DIALOGUE WITH BLANKS (Formatted)

**ALEX**: Hey Sam! ________ you been up to these days? It feels like forever since we last caught up.

**SAM**: I know, right? Honestly, work has been crazy. But I'm glad we're doing this. How about you? ________ much going on?

**ALEX**: Yeah, ________ been pretty hectic actually. But you know what? ________ I was thinking about something the other day. When we were kids, we had all these big dreams, didn't we?

**SAM**: Oh, ________ your point. I remember! You wanted to be an astronaut, right?

**ALEX**: ________ I did! And you were going to be a fireman, or something like that?

**SAM**: Ha! Yeah, I had big plans. But ________, as we grew up all that just kind of... disappeared. Between university, getting a job, paying bills... you know how it is.

**ALEX**: I know. That's what I've been struggling with lately, actually. It's ________ how all those childhood dreams just get lost in the adult world. Jobs, money, family responsibilities... ________

**SAM**: Yeah, ________ is quite sad when you think about it. But not for everyone though. Actually, I read this interesting book recently about people's life regrets.

**ALEX**: ________ about that? Tell me more.

**SAM**: Well, there's this Australian nurse called Bronnie Ware who interviewed terminally ill patients about their biggest regrets. And you know what the number one regret was?

**ALEX**: Hmm... was it something about money? Like, wishing they'd earned more?

**SAM**: No, actually. The biggest regret was not having the courage to ________ their dreams. Not following your passions – that's what people regret the most.

**ALEX**: Wow. That's... actually ________ quite powerful. ________ makes sense, I suppose. Following your dreams can be tough though, right?

**SAM**: True. But there are people who actually did it. Have you ever heard of the Zapp family? They're from Argentina.

**ALEX**: No, can't say I have. ________ about them?

**SAM**: In 2000, this couple – Herman and Candelaria – bought an old car with barely any money and just drove off to travel the world.

**ALEX**: ________ you serious? How long did they travel for?

**SAM**: Twenty-two years! Can you imagine? And they took their three kids with them. Visited over a hundred countries, met countless people along the way. Just completely transformed their lives.

**ALEX**: That's ________ incredible. How did they end up doing that? I mean, wasn't that quite... I don't know... outlandish?

**SAM**: Well, Herman and Candelaria, they had this dream as childhood sweethearts, and they ________ the bullet. But here's the interesting part – what changed him wasn't about ________ the world anymore.

**ALEX**: What do you mean?

**SAM**: He said something really beautiful. He was no longer the man who wanted to conquer the world – you know, like dominating it by force – but instead the world had ________ him. All these experiences, all the people he met... it made him much more humble.

**ALEX**: That's actually really profound. So he learned something about himself through all that travelling?

**SAM**: Exactly. He said something like... he's a beautiful but tiny ________ of sand. An important piece, but still just one tiny part of something much bigger.

**ALEX**: ________, that actually puts things in perspective. ________ what I mean. Life isn't just about conquering everything or achieving huge goals. It's about ________ and experiences, isn't it?

**SAM**: Right! And there's another story about Daisy. She moved to this community in New Zealand called Riverside where everything is shared. All the money, all the resources.

**ALEX**: ________ on earth! ________ everything? That seems pretty unusual to me.

**SAM**: I know, right? Most people think it's quite strange. But Daisy believes in it because she thinks sharing resources can give people a real advantage in life.

**ALEX**: ________ that with that though? I mean, doesn't everyone just want to keep what they earn?

**SAM**: That's what she said – people outside ________ community struggle with the idea. They can't really accept it or even think about it properly. It's just ________ so different from how most of us are brought up.

**ALEX**: Fair ________ . It takes courage to live that way, I suppose.

**SAM**: ________ true. But the point is, both Daisy and Herman – they ________ their dreams, and they ________ without regret. They didn't just talk about it; they actually did it.

**ALEX**: You know, I'm starting to think ________ maybe I should assess my own life a bit. What am I actually doing with my time?

**SAM**: That's the spirit! It doesn't ________ you have to travel the world or join a commune. It's about being true to yourself, right?

**ALEX**: ________ your point. ________ what would you do if you could do anything right now? Seriously, what ________ your dream?

**SAM**: Oh man, that's a tough question. I think I'd want to ________ more creative work. Maybe something with design or art. But I don't know... seems risky.

**ALEX**: But isn't that what the book was saying? That people regret not taking risks?

**SAM**: True. ________ I guess you're right. By the way, you've really got me thinking about this stuff.

**ALEX**: Good! ________ keep in touch more often and actually talk about these things, yeah? I don't want to get to the end of my life and regret not having these conversations with you.

**SAM**: ________ a deal. Let's make this a regular thing. And let's actually do something about our dreams instead of just talking.

**ALEX**: I like that. Come on, let's grab another coffee and ________ it over properly. I want to hear more about this creative work idea of yours.

**SAM**: Sounds good. ________ changing the subject, but do you remember that café we used to go to?

**ALEX**: Yeah, down by the river? Why?

**SAM**: They're ________ for people now. One of the owners is opening a new spot. I've been thinking maybe I should ________ if they need help with the design.

**ALEX**: ________ do it! ________ mentioned it – you should actually follow through.

**SAM**: You know what? ________ the conversation, I think I will. Better now than regretting it later, right?
