| "I'm unhappy with this" | Vague complaint | "It's affecting my ability to enjoy the property" |

## Real-World Context

### UK Tenant Rights
- Properties must be "fit for purpose" (habitable standard)
- Landlords must respond to repairs within reasonable timeframes
- Water leaks and heating = urgent (affect habitability)
- Emergency repairs can be legally forced

### US Tenant Rights (varies by state)
- "Habitability" includes heat, water, structural integrity
- Many states allow rent withholding for repairs
- Landlords have 14-30 days to respond (jurisdiction-specific)
- Emergency repairs may be tenant's responsibility if urgent

### Realistic Timelines
- Water leak: 7-10 days (urgent)
- Heating: 10-14 days (important, affects habitability)
- Window: 14-21 days (lower priority, non-urgent)
