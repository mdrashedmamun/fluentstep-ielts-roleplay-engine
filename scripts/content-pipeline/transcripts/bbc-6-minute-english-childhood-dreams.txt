Hello.
0:08
This is 6 Minute English from
0:09
BBC Learning English.
0:11
I'm Neil.
0:12
And I'm Beth.
0:13
When I was a boy, I wanted to be
0:15
a fireman when I grew up.
0:17
How about you, Beth?
0:18
Did you have
0:19
any childhood dreams?
0:20
I wanted to be an astronaut
0:22
and fly to the Moon…
0:24
When we're young most of us have
0:26
big dreams and plans for the future.
0:28
Unfortunately, as we grow up these
0:31
childhood dreams often get lost in the
0:33
adult world of jobs, money,
0:36
families and careers.
0:38
But not for everyone…
0:39
Daisy, from New Zealand, and, Herman,
0:42
from Argentina are two
0:44
people who decided
0:45
to follow their childhood dreams.
0:48
They
0:49
wanted the world to become a utopia – a
0:51
perfect, ideal society where everyone is
0:53
happy and gets along with each other.
0:56
In this programme, we'll be hearing how
0:58
Daisy and Herman made their dreams
1:01
come true – not by changing the world,
1:04
but by changing themselves.
1:06
And, as usual,
1:07
we'll be learning some new vocabulary too.
1:10
But before that I have a question
1:12
for you, Beth.
1:14
Following your dreams can
1:15
be tough, but not following them can leave
1:18
you regretting all the things you wanted
1:20
to do but didn't.
1:22
In 2012, Australian nurse,
1:24
Bronnie Ware, wrote her bestselling book,
1:26
The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, after
1:28
interviewing terminally ill patients about
1:31
their life regrets.
1:32
So, what do you think
1:34
their top regret was?
1:36
Was it:
1:37
a) I wish I hadn't worked so hard?
1:39
b) I wish I had followed my dreams?
1:42
or
1:43
c) I wish I'd made more money?
1:45
Well, I'll guess it's b) they wish they
1:48
had followed their dreams.
1:49
OK, Beth.
1:50
I'll reveal the correct answer
1:51
at the end of the programme.
1:53
The first dreamer we're going to meet lives
1:56
in Riverside, a peace-loving community in
1:59
New Zealand where everyone shares
2:01
everything.
2:02
Riverside members work for
2:04
the community's businesses, including
2:06
a farm, a hotel and a café.
2:10
All the money they
2:11
earn is collected and shared
2:13
between everyone equally.
2:14
Daisy, who was born in East Germany,
2:17
joined Riverside in 2004.
2:20
Here she explains
2:21
her belief in sharing to BBC
2:22
World Service programme, The Documentary.
2:26
What I think I always believed in is that
2:29
the sharing of resources can provide
2:31
a group of people with quite a great
2:33
advantage, but it doesn't matter how
2:35
many hours you work or what work
2:37
you do, everyone is getting the
2:39
same amount.
2:40
And that is something
2:41
that many people outside of
2:43
Riverside struggle with, and where
2:45
we're often getting this 'communism'
2:48
label attached to us, because it's so…
2:51
it seems so outlandish for people.
2:54
Riverside isn't a communist community.
2:57
In fact, people with many different political
3:00
views live there.
3:02
But Daisy says that local
3:03
people struggle with the idea that
3:06
everything is shared.
3:08
If you struggle with
3:09
an idea, you find it difficult to
3:11
accept or think about it.
3:13
Daisy also says some local people
3:15
call Riverside outlandish –
3:18
strange and unusual.
3:20
Our second group of dreamers are
3:22
a family - the Zapps.
3:24
In 2000, childhood
3:26
sweethearts, Herman and Candelaria Zapp,
3:29
bought a vintage car and set off
3:31
from Argentina to travel around
3:33
the world with less than 3.500 dollars
3:37
in their pockets.
3:38
Twenty-two years and
3:40
three children later they have visited
3:43
over a hundred countries, meeting
3:45
with countless people and
3:46
experiences on the way.
3:49
Here, Herman Zapp explains to BBC
3:51
World Service's, The Documentary, how
3:53
following his dream has
3:55
changed him for the better.
3:57
I am so happy with the Herman there is now,
4:00
that I know now – not the one who
4:02
wanted to conquer the world, but the one
4:04
who was conquered by the world.
4:06
I learn
4:07
so much from people, and it's
4:08
amazing how the more you meet people,
4:10
the more you know stories, how
4:12
much more humble you become because
4:14
you notice that you are a beautiful, tiny
4:17
piece of sand, but a very important piece
4:20
of sand like everyone is, right?
4:23
After many years travelling, meeting
4:25
new people and hearing their stories,
4:28
Herman is more humble – not proud or
4:31
arrogant.
4:32
He no longer wants to
4:33
conquer the world – to control it by force;
4:36
rather, he has been conquered
4:38
by his experiences.
4:41
Herman compares himself to a beautiful
4:43
but tiny piece of sand and uses the phrase
4:46
'a grain of sand' to describe things which
4:49
are insignificant in themselves, but
4:51
at the same time are an important
4:54
part of the whole.
4:55
Daisy and Herman are rare examples
4:58
of dreamers who followed their dream
5:00
and found a happy life, lived without
5:02
regret – which reminds me
5:04
of your question, Neil.
5:05
Yes, I asked about Bronnie Ware's book, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying.
5:11
What do you think the number one regret was, Beth?
5:14
I guessed it was b) not following your dreams.
5:18
Which was the right answer!
5:20
Not having
5:21
the courage to follow your dreams was
5:23
listed as the top life regret.
5:26
At least we
5:27
have people like Daisy and Herman
5:28
to remind us dreams can come true!
5:30
OK, let's recap the vocabulary from
5:33
this programme, starting with
5:35
'utopia' – a perfect world where
5:38
everyone is happy.
5:39
If you 'struggle with an idea',
5:41
you find it difficult to accept.
5:43
The adjective, outlandish, means
5:45
strange and unusual.
5:48
'To conquer' something means
5:49
to control it by force.
5:51
Someone who is 'humble' is
5:53
not proud or arrogant.
5:55
And finally, the phrase 'a grain of sand'
5:57
describes something which is both
5:59
insignificant yet somehow important.
6:02
Once again, our six minutes are up.
6:04
Bye for now!
6:05
Goodbye!
