A: I was scared, honestly. My family said I should [BLANK_2] a more stable job instead. They thought it was too risky. B: I understand the pressure. Do you regret not doing it sooner? A: Absolutely. I read this statistic that many people's top regret is not [BLANK_3] their dreams. B: That's powerful. So what's changed now? A: I realized life's too short to waste on regrets. That's why I'm determined to [BLANK_4] my dreams now, while I still can. B: I think that's the right decision. I mean, life's too short to [BLANK_5] your passion on hold forever. A: Exactly! I'd rather try and fail than spend my whole life wondering 'what if'. B: When do you plan to start? A: Next month. I'm going to [BLANK_6] my dreams properly this time. No more excuses. B: I really admire that. You know, I've been thinking about [BLANK_7] my own dreams too. A: Really? What would you like to do? B: I want to learn music seriously. I used to play guitar but stopped. A: So why don't you start again? You could [BLANK_8] that dream if you really wanted to. B: You're right. Seeing your determination actually inspires me. A: Then let's both [BLANK_9] our dreams together! We can support each other. B: I like that idea. Promise me you won't give up? A: I promise. And you should [BLANK_10] yours too.

A: It was the year 2000. They were young and idealistic. B: What made them decide to [[BLANK_7] such a risky venture? A: Herman said he wanted to understand the world better. B: And did he? A: Yes!

A: He understood that you can't [[BLANK_3]] through force or ambition alone. B: So what became his new goal? A: Instead of trying to [[BLANK_4]], he wanted to understand people and cultures.

A: His drive to [[BLANK_5]] was so strong that he missed the beauty around him. B: And now? A: Now he's at peace. He describes himself as a grain of sand—small but important. B: That's poetic. Do you think most ambitious people feel like they need to [[BLANK_6]]? A: Probably many do when they're young. Society encourages that mindset. B: But it's not sustainable? A: No, because you can never actually [[BLANK_7]] everything. It's impossible. B: So what advice would Herman give his younger self? A: Probably to stop trying to [[BLANK_8]] and just focus on being a good person. B: That's wise. I wonder how many powerful leaders wish they had learned this earlier? A: Probably many. Success often comes at the cost of this realization. B: Do you think young people should be taught not to [[BLANK_9]] so much? A: Maybe. Or taught that [[BLANK_10]] requires balance and compassion.",

A: That's a great insight. B: Yes. In his old mindset, he thought [BLANK_4] meant losing status. A: What made him change his thinking? B: Real-world experiences.

A: Also listening more than talking, which people often admit is difficult. B: That makes sense. The best leaders probably [[BLANK_8]. A: Definitely. Arrogant leaders often fail because they don't listen. B: So Herman's journey taught him wisdom? A: And more. He learned to [[BLANK_9] around others.

So dreams do [[BLANK_4] if you work for them? B: Exactly. You need three things: desire, effort, and often a bit of luck. A: It sounds simple when you put it that way. B: It's not always easy, but it's definitely possible. B: The question is whether you're willing to put in the work. A: What did your cousin say about her journey? B: That it was hard, sometimes she wanted to give up, but eventually it [[BLANK_5]]. B: Now she performs internationally. A: Wow! That gives me hope. What if I fail? B: Even if it doesn't [[BLANK_6] exactly as planned, you'll learn so much. A: That's a good point. Sometimes the journey is what matters. B: Absolutely. Plus, regret is worse than failure. A: Do you think my dream will [[BLANK_7]]? B: I think if you commit to it, yes. I really do. A: When should I start? B: Why not start now? The sooner you begin, the sooner it might [[BLANK_8]]. A: You're right. I've been procrastinating for years. B: Most people do. They wait for the perfect moment. A: But the perfect moment never comes, does it? B: No, you have to create it. Promise me you'll believe your dream can [[BLANK_9]]? A: I promise. Seeing how your cousin made it happen makes me believe it can [[BLANK_10] for me too.",
