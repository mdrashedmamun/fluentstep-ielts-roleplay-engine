# FluentStep Engine: Core Rules & Mission

## The Goal
The goal of this engine is **Fluency Acquisition** through the repetition of core patterns (Chunks), NOT vocabulary expansion.

## Global Rules (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Train Patterns, Not Vocab**: The system focuses on the automatic deployment of conversational moves.
2. **Novelty is a Bug**: Repetition is intentional. New phrasing is avoided unless absolutely unavoidable.
3. **Locked Chunk Priority**: The `LOCKED UNIVERSAL CHUNKS` set takes priority over all other phrasing.
4. **Style**: UK native, day-to-day English. Calm, understated, adult tone.

## Language Constraints
- **Prioritise Chunks**: Treat the locked set as the primary language inventory.
- **Repeat and Reuse**: Chunks must reappear intentionally within a single roleplay.
- **UK Context**: Ensure the style is natural for a UK native speaker.
- **Markdown Restriction**: NO markdown bolding in dialogue (asterisks or underscores).

## Locked Universal Chunks (Reference)

### Bucket A: Universal Chunks
- **Conversation Starters**: "Nice to meet you", "How is it going?", "What have you been up to?", "By the way...", "Let's change the subject", "Go straight to the point", "Am I making sense?", "Let’s keep in touch".
- **Agreements & Opinions**: "I see your point", "Fair enough", "That makes sense", "I beg to differ", "I’m not sure I agree with that", "I'd rather not", "Sounds good", "From my perspective...".
- **Requests & Help**: "Could you do me a favor?", "Give us a hand", "Do you mind if I...?", "Go ahead", "I appreciate your help/time", "Don't mention it".
- **Problems & Plans**: "Something has come up", "I'm in a hurry", "It's a shame", "These things happen", "Lesson learned".
- **Idioms**: "To be honest...", "Play it by ear", "On the spur of the moment", "Get off on the wrong foot", "A breath of fresh air", "Spill the beans", "Between you and me".

### Bucket B: Topic-Specific (Travel, Shopping, Hotels, Dining, Work, Health)
