Basics

Mini-Story 1: Meeting a New Flatmate  Prompt 1: First Meeting  Jack:   Hello, I’m Jack. I’m the new flatmate.  You:   Hello, my name is ________. Nice to ________ you.  Jack:   Nice to meet you too. So, this is the house.  It’s really ________, isn’t it?  You:   Yes, it is. But it’s very difficult to keep ________.  Jack:   Don’t worry. Your accent is very clear.  Where are you ________?  You:   I’m from ________.

Answers  1 ⃣   “It’s really ________, isn’t it?”  (Describing the house)  Positive options  1.   nice   – ultra-natural, safe, everyday  2.   lovely   – slightly warmer, very British  3.   spacious   – practical, adult, IELTS-friendly  4.   comfortable   – subtle, lived-in feel  5.   bright   – common when there’s good light  Neutral / realistic options  6.   simple   – honest, not flashy  7.   quiet   – implies comfort without praise  Mildly negative but polite  8.   small   – very common, not rude  9.   a bit old   – natural hedging, native style  10.   basic   – modern, understated critique  Native speakers love understatement. “Nice” beats “amazing” 90 percent of the time.  2 ⃣   “But it’s very difficult to keep ________.”  Top natural completions:  1.   clean   – default, perfect  2.   tidy   – slightly more British, very common  3.   organized   – neutral, slightly American  4.   in order   – softer, indirect  5.   neat   – concise, spoken English  IELTS tip:  “Clean” = dirt

“Tidy” = mess  Using the right one   underscores   precision.  3 ⃣   “Where are you ________?”  Only a few answers sound native here. These five are the   correct paradigm :  1.   from   – standard, universal  2.   originally from   – slightly more advanced  3.   based now   – modern, casual  4.   living now   – conversational  5.   coming from   – acceptable but less formal  For IELTS speaking:  “Originally from” quietly   elevates   your score.  4 ⃣   “Nice to ________ you.”  Don’t overthink this. Natives don’t.  1.   meet   – 95 percent usage  2.   finally meet   – only if you know them online  3.   see   – informal, British  4.   meet you too   – responsive, natural  5.   meet you in person   – context-specific  High-value insight (listen carefully)  Fluency isn’t about fancy words.  It’s about choosing the   most boring correct word   at the right time.  That’s how natives   surpass   learners.  Prompt 2: Background Talk  Jack:   That’s interesting. How long have you been living here?

You:   I’ve been living here for about ________.  Jack:   Do you like it so far?  You:   Yes, I do. The area is quite ________, and the people are very ________.  Jack:   That’s good to hear.  By the way, what do you do for ________?  You:   I work as a ________.  Answers  Line 1  “I’ve been living here for about ________.”  Verb + adverb time expressions (IELTS 9 safe)  Use   about / nearly / just over   naturally.  ●   about a year  ●   just over six months  ●   nearly two years  ●   around three months  ●   for quite a while   ← very native, slightly vague  Native insight:  Vagueness here is   commendable . Precision is not always power in spoken English.  Line 2  “The area is quite ________.”  Adjectives (top native / IELTS 9)  Positive:  1.   quiet   – gold standard  2.   convenient   – very IELTS  3.   pleasant   – subtle, grown-up  4.   lively   – positive energy  5.   peaceful   – calm, safe

Neutral / realistic:  6.   residential   – excellent but not flashy  7.   central   – factual, strong  8.   well-connected   – transport hint, very smart  Mildly negative but natural:  9.   a bit noisy   – hedged, native  10.   crowded   – honest, common  Avoid: “awesome”, “fantastic”, “super nice”. Those   undermine   range.  Line 3  “And the people are very ________.”  Adjectives natives love  1.   friendly   – default, never wrong  2.   welcoming   – IELTS upgrade  3.   polite   – understated, British  4.   helpful   – practical  5.   easy-going   – natural, conversational  Slightly advanced:  6.   open-minded   – careful, but good  7.   approachable   – Band 8.5–9 signal  Line 4  “What do you do for ________?”  (This line is Jack’s, but you should recognize it)  Verb phrase alternatives natives use:  ●   What do you do for work?  ●   What do you do for a living?  ●   What line of work are you in?   ← higher register  Understanding variations =   unparalleled   listening advantage.  Line 5

“I work as a ________.”  (We skip nouns as requested, but here’s how to   enhance   delivery)  Verb upgrades (IELTS 9 style)  Instead of just “I work as”:  ●   I currently work as…  ●   I’m mainly working as…  ●   I work full-time as…  ●   I’m involved in…   ← flexible, smart  ●   I’m employed as…   ← formal but valid  This   accentuates   fluency without risk.  Critical IELTS Truth (don’t ignore this)  IELTS 9 speakers:  ●   Use   simple words  ●   Combine them   meticulously  ●   Hedge naturally  ●   Sound human, not impressive  Prompt 3: Daily Life & Routines  Jack:   So, what do you usually do after work?  You:   I usually ________ home, have a quick ________, and then ________ for a while.  Jack:   Sounds relaxed. Do you go out during the week?  You:   Not very often. I mostly stay ________, but sometimes I ________ friends.  Jack:   And what about weekends?  You:   On weekends, I try to ________ up early, ________ some exercise, and ________ myself.

Answer  1 ⃣   “Do you prefer living ________?”  Adjectives / adverbs  ●   alone  ●   by myself  ●   on my own  ●   independently  ●   with others  “On my own” is very UK. “Independently” is rarer but sounds adult and deliberate.  2 ⃣   “I usually prefer living ________.”  Same pool, but here’s how natives vary tone:  ●   on my own   – most natural  ●   by myself   – neutral  ●   alone   – slightly blunt  ●   with people   – open, social  ●   with others   – polite, balanced  3 ⃣   “It’s more ________, and I can be more ________ with my time.”  First blank (adjectives)  ●   comfortable  ●   peaceful  ●   relaxed  ●   quiet  ●   stress-free  Second blank (adjectives / adverbs)  ●   flexible  ●   independent  ●   free  ●   organized  ●   relaxed  Very native combo examples:  ●   peaceful + flexible  ●   comfortable + independent  ●   quiet + relaxed  4 ⃣   “Are you an early bird or more of a ________ person?”  Adjectives  ●   night

●   cook with  ●   hang out with  “Join us” is the default. “Come with us” is casual and very spoken.  2 ⃣   “Yeah, that sounds ________.”  Adjectives  ●   nice  ●   good  ●   great  ●   lovely  ●   fun  UK speakers lean heavily on   nice   and   lovely . Simple beats dramatic.  3 ⃣   “What time are you ________?”  Verbs  ●   thinking  ●   planning  ●   aiming  ●   starting  ●   expecting  “Thinking” and “planning” are the most natural in this context.  4 ⃣   “I can ________ some food on the way home.”  Verbs  ●   pick up  ●   grab  ●   buy  ●   get  ●   bring  “Pick up” and “grab” are the most conversational.  5 ⃣   “Are you ________ about food?”  Adjectives  ●   fussy  ●   picky  ●   strict  ●   careful  ●   particular  “Fussy” is very British. “Picky” leans more American but still common.  6 ⃣   “I’m not ________ at all.

Manager:   Okay, let’s hear it.  You:   From my perspective, there might be a ________ risk if we proceed this way.  Colleague:   What kind of risk are you referring to?  You:   Mainly around ________ and how it could impact the final outcome.  Manager:   That’s interesting. Can you explain a bit more?  You:   Sure. Based on what we’ve seen so far, the current plan could ________ timelines and put extra pressure on the team.  Colleague:   I’m not sure I agree with that.  You:   That’s fair. I’m not saying the idea is ________, just that it may need some ________.  Manager:   What would you suggest instead?  You:   One option could be to ________ the rollout and test it on a smaller ________ first.  Colleague:   That might slow things down.  You:   Possibly in the short term, yes. But in the long run, it could ________ rework and reduce overall risk.  Manager:   I see both sides here.  You:   Ultimately, I’m happy to support whichever direction we choose.  I just wanted to ________ this concern before we commit.  Colleague:   I appreciate you explaining it that way.  Manager:   Alright.

You:   I agree timing is ________.  My concern is that moving too quickly here could create ________ issues later.  Manager:   We can’t design for every possible risk.  You:   Absolutely. I’m not suggesting we cover ________.  I’m referring to one specific area that might ________ the rollout.  Manager:   From my point of view, that risk is acceptable.  You:   That’s fair.  Can I just clarify how we’re planning to ________ that risk if it materialises?  Manager:   We’ll deal with it if it comes up.  You:   Understood.  My hesitation is that fixing it later may be more ________ and disruptive than addressing it now.  Manager:   So what exactly are you proposing at this stage?

You:   Success would be a quick ________ check, clear ownership,  and a go/no-go decision within ________ days.  Manager:   That’s still a risk.

You:   Agreed.  But in my view, it’s a ________ risk than proceeding without validation.  Manager:   Okay. I’m not convinced, but I hear you.  You:   That’s all I was hoping for.  Even if we move forward unchanged, I appreciate you ________ the concern.  Manager:   Let’s do this.  Put together a short summary, no more than ________ page,  and we’ll review it tomorrow.

Before we circulate it more widely, I wanted to walk through a few ________ points with you.  Colleague:   Sure. What did you think?  You:   Overall, the structure is solid, and the effort is clear.  That said, there are a few areas where the report could be ________.  Colleague:   Okay. Which parts specifically?  You:   Starting with the executive summary, I think the key message gets a bit ________.  It might help to make the main takeaway more ________ upfront.  Colleague:   I was trying to give more context there.  You:   That makes sense.  The challenge is that senior readers tend to focus on ________ first,  so clarity there really ________.  Colleague:   Fair point.  You:   In the analysis section, some of the assumptions aren’t fully ________.  For example, the projection around ________ could use a bit more explanation.  Colleague:   I didn’t want to overcomplicate it.  You:   I appreciate that.  It’s a balance, but right now it might feel a bit ________ to someone less close to the work.  Colleague:   Got it.  You:   Another thing to flag is tone.

In a few places, the language comes across as quite ________,  which might invite pushback from stakeholders.  Colleague:   That wasn’t intentional.  You:   I know.  I think softening it slightly and grounding it more in ________ would help.  Colleague:   Okay, that’s helpful.  You:   On the recommendations page, I’d suggest tightening the list.  At the moment, there are ________ actions, and they’re not all equally ________.  Colleague:   Do you think we should cut some?  You:   Either cut or clearly ________ them.  That way, it’s obvious what’s critical versus what’s ________.  Colleague:   Makes sense.  You:   Finally, before we send this out, I’d recommend a quick ________ pass  just to improve flow and remove repetition.  Colleague:   That’s fair.  You:   To be clear, the content is there.  This is more about ________ and making sure the report lands the way we intend.  Colleague:   I appreciate you saying that.  You:   Of course.  I know you put a lot of ________ into this, and these tweaks are about making it stronger.  Colleague:   Thanks. How urgent do you think the changes are?  You:   Ideally, we’d address them before ________.  I don’t think it requires a full rewrite, just some ________ revisions.  Colleague:   Okay. I can work on it today.  You:   Great.  If you want, I’m happy to ________ the next draft or talk through any sections.  Colleague:   That would be helpful.  You:   Perfect.  Let’s aim to align on a final version by ________.
