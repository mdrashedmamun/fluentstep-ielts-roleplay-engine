## Detailed Scenario Descriptions

### 1. ACADEMIC-1-TUTORIAL-DISCUSSION

**Setting**: Oxford/Cambridge university tutorial
**Context**: Undergraduate student discussing essay structure and argument development with academic tutor
**Characters**: Dr. Harrison (tutor), Student

**British English Features**:
- Academic register: "endeavour", "thesis", "textual analysis"
- Idioms: "in two minds", "gather evidence", "unpack arguments"

- "keen on unpacking" (enthusiasm with sophistication)
- "sacrifice to word count" (prioritization language)

**Deep Dive Examples**:
```
"in two minds" → British idiom for genuine indecision, more emotionally
nuanced than "undecided". Band 8-9 marker for ambivalent reasoning.

and registers as experienced researcher maintaining nuance.
```

**IELTS Value**: Models sophisticated academic discussion with natural hedging, politeness, and intellectual reasoning.

## Design Philosophy

### Why These Categories?

3. Healthcare-1 (clinical but empathetic)
4. Workplace-1 (professional but feedback-focused)

## Deep Dive Philosophy

### What Makes Deep Dives Effective?

**Good Deep Dive**:
> "British idiom for genuine indecision, more emotionally nuanced than 'undecided'. Band 8-9 marker for ambivalent reasoning."

**Why**: Explains WHY the phrase is native, references Band level, teaches transferable pattern.

**Bad Deep Dive**:
> "Means unable to decide between two options."

**Why**: Just defines the phrase (learner already knows this from context).

### Deep Dive Coverage

- 3-4 insights per scenario (30-40% of blanks)
- Focused on highest-value teaching moments
- Each insight explains register, Band marker, or cultural context
- Teach patterns that transfer to other scenarios

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

2. **B2 Equivalents**: Develop Band 6.5-7.5 versions of each scenario

4. **Performance Data**: Analyze learner success rates to validate difficulty calibration

### Long-Term Growth
